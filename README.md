Using virtual reality to boost the effectiveness of brain-computer interface applications

Implementation of the paper titled "Using virtual reality to boost the effectiveness of brain-computer interface applications" - find it [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9031021).

Over the years, BCI has been extensively experimented with to create user friendly applications for the old and disabled.
But the BCI has very limited functionality;hence to enhance the functionality we integrate it with VR which will increase the scope of usefulness substantially. 
Proposed solution is to build a functional prototype of motorized wheel chair controlled by BCI and VR.
Our proposed model is cost effective because it requires most basic BCI device and VR which is inexpensive and can be easily deployed.
